Pour enough olive oil into large saucepan to reach depth of 1 1/2 inches. Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of pan with bulb submerged in oil; heat oil to 360°F. Working in batches, fry dough twists in oil until golden on all sides, turning occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer fried pastries to paper towels to drain. Cool completely. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature. Line another large baking sheet with parchment paper. Bring honey to simmer in medium saucepan. Remove from heat. Cool until just warm. Whisk powdered sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in medium bowl to blend. Working with 1 fried pastry at a time, dip pastry into warm honey. Lift pastry and shake gently, allowing excess honey to drip back into pan. Roll pastry in powdered sugar mixture to coat. Place on prepared baking sheet. Arrange pastries on platter. For the best results, dip the pastry twists in a mild-flavored honey, such as orange blossom. An assertively flavored honey will overwhelm the pastry and the spiced powdered sugar.

The wine\\'s spicy raisin notes are complemented by bitter almond flavors and an apricot finish.

       " 'Recipe for Polenta With Mushrooms  | Put the dried mushrooms in a medium bowl and pour in the boiling water. Press them down into the water now and then until they are soft, anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes depending on how dry they were. When it’s time to cook them, lift them out of the water with your hands or a slotted spoon and chop them roughly. Reserve the soaking water. Put the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When it’s hot, add the soaked dried and fresh mushrooms and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are tender and have released all their liquid. 10 to 15 minutes. Add the wine and let it bubble away for 1 minute, then stir in the garlic, 1/4 cup of the parsley, and 1 cup of the reserved soaking water. Cook until the liquid thickens a bit, another 2 or 3 minutes, then taste, adjust the seasoning, and turn off the heat under the skillet. Put the polenta in a medium pot with 1 cup water and whisk to form a smooth slurry. Whisk in the milk and a pinch of salt and set the pot over medium-high heat. Heat until the mixture boils then lower the heat to medium and cook, whisking frequently adding more water a little at a time to prevent lumps and keep the mixture somewhat soupy. Expect to add another 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 cups of water before the polenta is ready. The polenta will be done in 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the grind. It will be thick and creamy, with just a little grittiness, and the mixture will pull away from the sides of the pan when you stir.

Serve the polenta topped with the mushrooms and garnished with the remaining 1/4 cup parsley. Soaking Dried Mushrooms: The time needed to soften mushrooms depends on their size and age. They’re ready when you can cut one easily with a paring knife. You want to reserve the soaking liquid but leave the grit behind, so lift out the mushrooms rather than pouring to drain them. Making The Sauce: When the mushrooms are tender and the wine has bubbled away, stir in the garlic, parsley, and soaking water. Making Polenta by the Slurry Method: When the slurry just starts to boil, turn it down a bit so it bubbles gently. Add more water or stir with a wooden spoon. Recognizing Doneness: When the polenta starts to pull away from the pan and is no longer gritty, it’s time to stir in the butter and Parmesan.',\n",

       " 'Recipe for Deep-Fried Turkey with Herbs  | Place the turkey in the empty fryer pot and cover it with about 2 inches of water. Remove the turkey from the pot, dry it thoroughly with paper towels, and set it aside at room temperature. Use a waterproof marker to mark the water level on the inside or outside of the pot so you know how much oil to put in the pot. Discard the water then wash and dry the pot thoroughly. Arrange the burner on a flat surface far away from the house, garage, or anything that could easily catch fire. Place the pot over the burner and clip a long-pronged deep-fry thermometer to the side of the pot. Using the mark you made earlier, fill the pot with oil. Heat the oil until the thermometer reaches 375°F. While the oil is heating, make the rub: In a small bowl, whisk together the salt, pepper, thyme, rosemary, and paprika. DO AHEAD: The herb rub can be prepared ahead and kept, in an airtight container, up to 1 month. Starting at the neck end of the turkey, slowly and carefully slide your hand between the skin and the meat of the breast, thighs, and upper drumsticks to separate and loosen the skin. Spread the herb rub under the skin on the thighs, drumsticks, and breasts. Spread any remaining rub inside the turkey cavity and on top of the skin. To ensure good oil flow, make sure the neck cavity is wide open, and use a small sharp knife to cut a small slit through the skin where the leg meets the breast. Place the turkey on the poultry rack, with the breast facing down and the legs facing up. Once the oil reaches 375°F, turn off the burner. Wearing an apron and long heavy-duty oven mitts, use the hook that attaches to the rack to slowly lower the turkey into the oil using a stop-and-go method—slowly lower the turkey 1 to 2 inches into the oil then pull it back out a bit, repeating until the bird is fully submerged. Turn the burner back on and bring the oil to 350°F. Throughout frying, adjust the heat as necessary to maintain the 350°F oil temperature. Fry the turkey for about 3 1/2 minutes per pound. Use the hook that attaches to the rack to slowly and carefully remove the turkey from the oil and place it on a cutting board or large rimmed baking sheet. Using an instant-read thermometer, test the fleshy part of the thighs and the thickest part of the breasts (test both sides, close to but not touching the bone); the thermometer needs to register at least 165°F. If not, use the hook to slowly and carefully lower the turkey back into the oil to finish frying. Once the internal temperature reaches 165°F, transfer the turkey to a cutting board, cover with foil, and let it rest 20 to 30 minutes before carving and serving.',\n",

       " 'Recipe for Michael Lewis\\'s Cassoulet de Canard  | Bring 5 quarts water to a boil in an 8-quart heavy pot. Boil beans, uncovered, 1 1/2 minutes, then turn off heat and let them soak 50 minutes. While beans soak, do all the really disgusting work with the meat. Put pork rind in a 3-quart saucepan three-fourths full of cold water and bring to a boil. Boil pork rind 1 minute. Drain and rinse under cold running water, then do it again. (Sometimes you know it\\'s ready because it grows nipples.) After draining, cut the truly repulsive boiled pork rind into pieces that are big enough to identify (about 2 inches), so you can fish them out before serving. Scrape off and discard fat from confit duck legs and shred meat (the more it shreds the better). [Editors\\' note: Those who have no problem with identifiable meat in their food might want to keep the shredding to a minimum.] Put parsley stems, thyme, whole cloves, and 8 garlic cloves in cheesecloth and tie into a bundle to make a bouquet garni. First seasoning of beans: Add rind pieces, bacon halves, 1 cup onion, bouquet garni, and salt to beans. Simmer, covered, 1 1/4 hours, skimming regularly. Cool, uncovered. While beans simmer, brown mutton bones. Do this by heating goose fat in enameled cast-iron pot over moderate heat until it smokes, then cook mutton bones, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Set them aside on a plate. Drop remaining 2 cups onion into pot and brown that, too. This can take as long as 15 minutes. Stir regularly. Peel seed, and chop tomatoes. Flavoring the meat: Add browned bones and shredded duck to onion. Add bay leaves, beef stock, tomatoes, remaining 4 garlic cloves, white wine, and pepper. Simmer, covered, 1 1/2 hours. Cool to room temperature,uncovered. Put pot with meat and pot with beans in refrigerator, covered, overnight. Poke holes in sausage with a fork and grill it slowly in a well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately low heat 20 minutes (to get the fat out). (Sausage should still be slightly undercooked on the inside when you\\'re done.) Transfer to a cutting board and cool slightly. Slice into thin (1/4-inch) rounds. Remove and discard bones and bay leaves from meat pot. Remove duck with a slotted spoon and put on a plate. Reserve cooking liquid remaining in pot. Remove bacon from beans and cut into tiny, fat-free pieces. Put pieces on a plate and discard remaining bacon fat. Discard pork rind and bouquet garni from beans. Julia Child says: \"Now is the time to drain the beans and dump them into the ample, leftover meat cooking juices.\" In my experience, there is nothing left to drain. What you are looking at, when you stare into the bean pot, is a fairly solid wall of beans, with some gluey goop in between. So, pour reserved meat cooking juices into bean pot. Bring to a simmer over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, and simmer 5 minutes, skimming any scum. Then turn off heat and let sit another 5 minutes. Preheat oven to 375°F. Spread a layer of beans on bottom of enameled cast-iron pot. Layer half of sausage and bacon on top, then another layer of beans, then half of duck (and any mutton), then another layer of beans, et cetera, ending with a layer of beans. Then add enough remaining liquid from bean pot until beans are submerged. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and parsley. Bring the whole thing to a simmer, uncovered, over moderately low heat. Then stick it in oven 20 minutes. Break through bread crumbs in several places with a spoon, allowing the liquid to mess up the look of the thing. Then reduce heat to 350°F and leave it in another 40 minutes. Serve very hot.',\n",

Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them roughly into 1 inch pieces. When the water’s boiling, add salt to taste, and then the sweet potato pieces, and cook them for about 10 minutes or until they are soft. Scoop them out of the water into a bowl–using a ”spider” or slotted spoon–and lightly mash with a fork, without turning them into a purée. Don’t get rid of this water, as you will need it to cook your pasta in later. In another saucepan, gently melt the butter and add the flour, whisking to form a roux, then take the pan off the heat, slowly whisk in the milk and, when it’s all combined and smooth, put back on the heat. Exchange your whisk for a wooden spoon, and continue to stir until your gently bubbling sauce has lost any floury taste and has thickened. Add the mustard and ¼ teaspoon of the paprika. Season to taste, but do remember that you will be adding Cheddar and salty feta later, so underdo it for now. Cook the pennette in the sweet-potato water, starting to check 2 minutes earlier than packet instructions dictate, as you want to make sure it doesn’t lose its bite entirely. Drain (reserving some of the pasta cooking water first) and then add the pennette to the mashed sweet potato, and fold in to combine; the heat of the pasta will make the mash easier to mix in. Add the feta cheese to the sweet potato and pasta mixture, crumbling it in so that it is easier to disperse evenly, then fold in the white sauce, adding 1 1/4 cups grated Cheddar as you go. Add some of the pasta cooking water, should you feel it needs loosening up at all. Check for seasoning again, then, when you’re happy, spoon the brightly sauced macaroni cheese into 4 small ovenproof dishes of approx. 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cup capacity (or 1 large rectangular dish measuring approx. 12x8x2 inches deep and 6 1/2 cup capacity).

       " \"Recipe for Reheating Corn Tortillas  | There are several methods for reheating corn tortillas: dry heat (gas flame), moist heat (steamer and microwave) and oily heat (dry-frying). This method works only if your tortillas have been made that day. Heat the tortillas directly over the flame (or on a griddle or skillet), flipping them until toasty and pliable. This is easier for larger quantities of corn tortillas, especially if you need to hold them hot for a little while. Pour 1/2 inch water into the bottom of the steamer, then line the steaming basket with a clean, heavy kitchen towel. Lay the tortillas in the basket in stacks of 12 (a small vegetable steamer will accommodate only one stack; a large Asian steamer will hold three or four stacks). Fold the edges of the towel over the tortillas to cover them, set the lid in place, bring the water to a boil and let boil only for 1 minute, then turn off the fire and let stand, covered, for 15 minutes. If you wish to keep the tortillas hot for up to an hour, slip the steamer into a low oven or reheat the water periodically. This easy method works best with no more than a dozen tortillas. Drizzle a clean kitchen towel with 3 tablespoons water and wring the towel to even distribute the moisture. Use the towel to line a microwave-safe casserole dish (8 or 9 inches in diameter is best). Lay in a dozen tortillas, cover with the towel and the lid, then microwave at 50 percent power for 4 minutes. Let stand for 2 to 3 minutes. The tortillas will stay warm for 20 minutes. Though it's not much a part of home cooking, street vendors of seared-meat tacos reheat fresh tortillas with the heat of a slightly oily griddle — they're not so much frying the tortillas (which would mean completely submerging the tortillas in oil) as griddle-heating them with a tiny bit of oil. When just-baked tortillas come off the griddle or when they've been reheated, they're traditionally kept warm in a tightly woven basket (chiquihuite) lined with a cloth; some have lids, others don't. In the Yucatan, they use hollowed-out gourds. And in modern households, they use Styrofoam containers — which are so efficient that they now come in many decorated styles. If you're having a party, hold hot tortillas in an insulated chest (like an ice chest) lined with a towel.\",\n",

       " \"Recipe for Basic Duck Stock  | Coat the carcasses and various bird bits with oil. Salt them well and put in a large roasting pan. Put in the oven, turn on the oven to 400°F, and roast for about 1 hour, until well browned. Meanwhile, score the pig's foot all over, or chop the duck feet with a cleaver or other heavy knife, to break the skin and expose the joints and bones. There is collagen in the feet that will seep into the water and give the finished stock more body. When the carcasses are ready, remove them from the oven and chop them into large pieces with heavy kitchen shears or a cleaver. This will make it possible to fit them all into your stockpot. Transfer them to a large stockpot and add the feet. Pour in cold water to cover everything by about 1 inch. Turn the heat to medium, bring to a bare simmer, and cook very gently for 2 to 8 hours. Do not let this boil. Meanwhile, put the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic in the roasting pan and stir to coat with the fat that has rendered from the duck bits. If you are using domestic ducks or fatty wild ones, you may have too much fat: if you have a pool of fat at the bottom of the roasting pan, drain off all but about 3 tablespoons. You can strain the fat and reuse it (it's great for roasting potatoes). Put the vegetables in the oven and roast for about 45 minutes, until browned. When the vegetables are browned, pour about 4 cups water into the roasting pan and scrape up any browned bits with a wooden spoon. When the stock has simmered for at least 2 hours, add the vegetables, the liquid from the roasting pan, and all the remaining ingredients. Stir well and simmer, uncovered, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours longer. Turn off the heat and strain the stock. Set up a fine-mesh sieve over another large pot (you may need 2 pots if you don't have a second large pot). Line the sieve with a piece of plain paper towel or cheesecloth and ladle the stock through the sieve. Change the paper towel or rinse the cheesecloth once or twice. This step is vital to making a clear stock. Do not attempt to capture the last dregs of stock at the bottom of the pot, or you will have cloudy stock. Your stock is now ready. Season to taste with salt, adding a little at a time. Skip the salting if you want to further concentrate flavors by simmering the strained stock for as long as you like. Check every 15 minutes or so to see if the flavor is as you want it. Transfer the stock to jars, let cool, cover, and refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 9 months. Alternatively, pressure can the stock and store for up to 1 year.\",\n",

Stir in 1/3 cup ice water and, if necessary, continue to add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture forms a soft dough. Gather the dough into a ball, form it into a 5-inch square, and dust it lightly with flour. Chill the dough, wrapped in wax paper, for 30 minutes, or until it is firm but not hard. In a bowl combine the remaining 2 1/4 sticks butter, cut into bits, with the remaining 1/4 cup flour and toss the mixture to coat the butter with the flour. Knead the butter and the flour together and form the mixture into a rough square. Put the square between sheets of wax paper and with a rolling pin press it into a 5-inch square. Remove the paper, dust the square well with flour, and wrap it in another sheet of wax paper. Chill the butter mixture until it is firm but not hard.

Roll the dough from the center away from you to within 1/2 inch of the end. Flatten the ends gently with uniform impressions but do not roll the pin over the ends or the air and butter will be expelled. Reverse the strip on the surface, flouring the surface as necessary, and again roll the dough from the center away from you to make a rectangle about 12 inches long. Turn the dough seam side up, brush any excess flour from it, and fold the rectangle in thirds as before.
